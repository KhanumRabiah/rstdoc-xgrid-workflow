.. _`rstreimg`:

rstreimg
========

| rstreimg: shell command
| reimg: rstdoc module

Reimg renames the images in the rst file and the files themselves.
It uses part of the document name and a number as new names.

This is useful, if more RST documents converted from DOCX
should be combined in one directory and
the names of the images have no meaning (image13,...).
